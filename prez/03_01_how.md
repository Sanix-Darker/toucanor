## HOW I USE IT
```python
# watch each key and react in an infinite loop
import keyboard
from threading import Thread

def get_key(key):
    while True:
        keyboard.wait(key)
        # move left
        if key == "Left":
            ...
        # move right
        if key == "Right":
            ...
        # move down
        if key == "Down":
            ...
        # move up
        if key == "Up":
            ...

keys = ["Left", "Right", "Up", "Down"]
threads = [ Thread(target=get_key, kwargs={"key": key}) for key in keys ]

for thread in threads:
    thread.start()
